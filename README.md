# elevatorSimulator

To run the program: first compile Elevator.py and Person.py, then runAI.py, then finally run main.py.

IF YOU JUST WANT TO WITNESS THE PROGRAM IN ACTION, USE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS:

1) When main.py is run, a window will pop up, click on "type" and then enter the values 100 for time and 200 for people; click continue.
2) On the next screen, draw a straight line across the middle of the graph, then click continue in the bottom right.
3) On the next two screens, just click the "continue" button in the bottom right of the windows.  
4) In the next window, you can adjust the slider at the top of the screen depending upon the speed at which you would like to view the simulation.
